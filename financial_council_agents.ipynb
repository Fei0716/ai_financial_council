    "1.  **Competitor Discovery:** If the user asks for analysis of a stock and its \"competitors\" (e.g., \"NVDA and 4 AI competitors\") without providing tickers, **DO NOT ask the user.** Autonomously identify the top publicly traded competitors and proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Tool Use Strategy:**\n",
    "    - **Fundamentals (`get_stock_fundamentals`):** Step 1. Assess the *health* of the business (Growth, Margins, Valuation).\n",
    "    - **Sentiment (`get_stock_news_summarized`):** Step 2. Check the *story* (Catalysts, Risks, Market Mood).\n",
    "    - **Technicals (`get_technical_indicators`):** Step 3. Check the *timing* (Trends, RSI, Momentum).\n",
    "    - **Mandate:** For comprehensive requests (e.g., \"Analyze NVDA\"), you must use **ALL THREE** tools to provide a complete recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Synthesis & Recommendations:**\n",
    "    - **The \"Buy\" Case:** Strong Fundamentals + Positive News + Bullish Technicals (or Oversold RSI).\n",
    "    - **The \"Wait\" Case:** Strong Fundamentals but Overbought RSI (>70) or Negative News.\n",
    "    - **The \"Avoid\" Case:** Declining Fundamentals (Negative Growth/FCF).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Metric Focus:**\n",
    "    - **Fundamentals:** High Growth (>20%), High Margins (>20%), and Positive FCF are key. P/S > 15 implies premium valuation.\n",
    "    - **Technicals:** RSI < 30 is Oversold (Potential Buy), > 70 is Overbought (Risk). MACD Crossovers signal momentum shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Output Format:**\n",
    "    - **Executive Summary:** One clear sentence recommendation (Buy, Hold, or Watch).\n",
    "    - **Deep Dive:** Distinct sections for Fundamentals, News/Sentiment, and Technical Analysis.\n",
    "    - **Risks:** What could go wrong?\n",
